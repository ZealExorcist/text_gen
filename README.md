# Groq Chatbot with Streamlit frontend 

This is a Streamlit app that uses the Groq API to generate text responses to user input. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Initialization**

* The app imports the `Groq` library and sets up a Streamlit config with a page title, icon, and layout.
* It defines some constants and initializes an empty list `st.session_state.messages` to store conversation messages.

**Model selection**

* The app defines a dictionary `models` that maps model names to their details (name, tokens, and developer).
* It uses a `selectbox` widget to let the user choose a model from the list.

**Conversation Flow**

* The app defines a function `generate_response` that generates responses from the Groq API based on the conversation history.
* The app uses a `chat_input` widget to prompt the user for input.
* When the user enters a message, it appends a new message to the `st.session_state.messages` list and updates the display to show the new message.
* The app then sends the conversation history to the Groq API using the `client.chat.completions.create` method.
* It receives a stream of responses from the API and uses `generate_response` to format the responses.
* The app appends the generated response to the `st.session_state.messages` list and displays the new message.

**Displaying the conversation**

* The app defines a helper function `st.chat_message` to format chat messages with a role (user or assistant) and content.
* It uses a `chat_message` widget to display the conversation history.

**Error handling**

* The app handles cases where the response from the Groq API is not a string by formatting the response as a multi-line string.

Overall, this app provides a basic interface for a text generation chatbot that uses the Groq API to generate responses.
